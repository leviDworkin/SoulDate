# SoulDate
This is a dating app for young individuals to potentially meet their soul mates.<br />
How it works: Everyone should download the app, even people already married or with a boy/girlfriend,
and their friends can see all of their other single friends. If they would like to find out if 
a specific friend would be interested in dating or if s/he is a good potential then they could 
ask their friend about him/her and then they can mediate between them and set them up.
